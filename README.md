# Bird-Game

Overview:
You control a bird flying low over a road in a busy city. You will have to maneuver the bird around various obstacles so that the bird doesn’t run into anything. Since the bird is in a city road, obstacles could include cars (of various sizes), a tunnel, big signs, etc. 

Objectives:
The primary goal of the game is to keep the bird safe. However, you can also pick up coins along the way or get coins from doing tricks, which can be used to upgrade your bird or buy skins. 

Controls and levels:
There are two ways of controlling the bird. First, using WASD and mouse to directly control the bird’s movement. Second, using some kind of preset key pattern (ie SSS or WWW) which will cause the bird to pull up or dive down much more than it could with the manual WASD controls. In earlier levels, you will not need to use these preset patterns to win, but higher levels will be impossible to beat without using it. Each level will get more difficult with more obstacles, bigger jumps in obstacle sizes, and different speeds of obstacles coming.

Experimental feature:
In addition, at the end of each level, the bird will reach a park where it encounters a hunter. To beat the level, you must dodge the hunter’s shots. The hunter will increase in difficulty with every level.

Multiplayer:
In multiplayer mode, two people will fly birds simultaneously on one screen together. The camera view will zoom out a little bit and the obstacles may be tweaked a little. The birds are working together, but if one person dies, the other may keep playing. The hunter portion will be different for multiplayer as now the birds will have to attack the hunter. This section is much easier to beat with both players alive, so it is important for both players to make it through the city part of the level. 

Characters, objects, sprites:
The game includes many characters and sprites for the bird, the cars and other obstacles, and the hunter. As upgrades and skins are purchased, these sprites will change.

Overlay:
In terms of overlay there will be a home page where you can select which level you want to play. Each successive level can only be unlocked by beating the one prior.
